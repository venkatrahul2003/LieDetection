# **Lie Detection Using CNN Video Analytics**
__Introduction__
Welcome to the GitHub repository for our project on "Lie Detection Using CNN Video Analytics"! Our aim is to explore the capabilities of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in detecting lies by analyzing facial expressions in videos.

__Project Background__
Lie detection is a challenging field with significant importance in various sectors, including security, law enforcement, and human resources. Traditional methods like polygraph tests have been widely used but come with limitations in accuracy and applicability. Our project addresses these challenges by leveraging the advancements in machine learning, particularly CNNs, to analyze facial expressions for lie detection.

__Objective__
The primary objective of this project is to develop an efficient and accurate lie detection system. We focus on creating a custom dataset, extracting relevant features from video frames, and training a CNN algorithm to distinguish between lying and truth-telling based on facial expressions.

__Methodology__
Data Collection: We have collected videos of individuals lying and telling the truth. From these videos, we extract frames to serve as our dataset.
CNN Model: Our approach involves using a CNN model with ReLU and Softmax functions to analyze the video frames.
Application Development: We have integrated this model into a mobile application that can capture videos in real-time and predict the likelihood of lying.

__Current Status and Future Work__
Our initial tests have shown promising results, with the model achieving an accuracy of 90%. However, we encountered and addressed challenges related to overfitting. We are continuously working on improving the accuracy and reliability of our system, with plans to enhance its real-world applicability.
